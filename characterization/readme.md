Here, three test benches are utilized to characterize the EF_DACR0801.
* power_supply_ripple_rejection
    - power suppy ripple rejection (psrr) is calculated at different levels of frequency from 10Hz to 10Mhz
* settling_time
    - DAC full-scale settling time is calculated at different levels of the reference voltage (VH) from 2.4V to 3.3V
* transient
    - simulation of the transient time is exploited to estimate the INL and DNL paramters of the EF_DACR0801
