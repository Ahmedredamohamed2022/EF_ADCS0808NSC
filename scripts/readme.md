* Here, scripts have been developed using open-source tools such as Python language. 
  - inl_dnl_v1 is used to read raw file of the EF_DACR0801 and then,  calculate Differential Non-Linearity (DNL) and Integral Non-Linearity (INL)
  - lef_script can write LEF-format file by reading the GDS file.
  - lvs_script is developed to compare two netlists, one is generated from XSCHEM and another one is extracted from the layout.
