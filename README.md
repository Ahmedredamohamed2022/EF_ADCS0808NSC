# Open Source, 8-Channel, 8-Bit, 80KSPS, SAR ADC
## 1. Description
* The EF_ADCS0808NSC is a low-power, 8-channel CMOS 8-bit analogue-to-digital converter with a flexible parallel interface. Moreover, start-of-conversion (SOC) and end-of-conversion (EOC) terminals facilitate the sample rate operating range. The converter is based on a successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture with an internal track-and-hold circuit. It can be configured to accept a 2.5 V single-ended input span. The output parallel data is binary and compatible with many common DSP parallel interfaces. The EF_ADCS0808NSC operates with a dual power supply; 1.8 V and 3.3 V supply the digital and analogue IP blocks, respectively. Normal power consumption reaches 0.92 mW in idle mode. The functional block diagram is presented in Figure 1.
